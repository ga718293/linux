Linux kernel
============
This is the OpenBMC Kernel mirror, that can be used by anyone.
I will maintain some hardware device drivers for component on 
lastest server machine.

You can pickup the code as you needed and distribution it on
your platform.

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:
